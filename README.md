Final Project – Web Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my web portfolio built with Bootstrap. The portfolio showcases my background, my projects, and my contact information as a web developer.

## Development Process

The development of this portfolio began with the planning phase, where I sketched out the design and layout of the site using wireframes and flowcharts. I chose Bootstrap for its responsiveness and the variety of components it offers, which enhanced the site's design while maintaining functionality across different devices.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Bootstrap** - for responsive design

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Responsive Design
Ensuring that the website was fully responsive and looked good on all devices was initially a challenge.

**Solution:** Leveraged Bootstrap’s grid system and responsive utilities. Regular testing on various devices and using browser developer tools to simulate different screen sizes helped make adjustments as needed.

### Challenge 2: Portfolio Gallery
Creating a dynamic and attractive portfolio gallery that could display my projects effectively was another challenge.

**Solution:** Used Bootstrap's cards and modal components to create a visually appealing gallery. This allowed visitors to click on project cards for more detailed views.

### Challenge 3: Load Time Optimization
As I added more content, the site’s load time began to increase, impacting user experience.

**Solution:** Optimized images. Minified CSS files to reduce the load time.

## Lessons Learned

Building this portfolio taught me a great deal about web development, especially in the areas of UI/UX design and front-end development. I improved my skills in responsive design and learned how to effectively use Bootstrap components to enhance site interactivity. I also gained experience in optimizing web content for faster loading times and better performance.
